# Project Final
Hello everyone,

We are Pennet Team, specializing in implementing pentesting methodologies for network security. This is our graduation project focusing on the small enterprise network model.

The tools we have integrated include aircrack-ng, nmap, and routersploit.

We implemented this project on gns3 and used physical wireless network devices to perform pentesting.
Our tool can be implemented in two directions: Black box and white box

Thank you everyone for using it
