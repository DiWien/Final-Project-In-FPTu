# Research and build tools to support the network system penetration testing process
Final Project
Hello everyone,

We are the Pennet Team, dedicated to deploying cutting-edge pentesting methodologies to enhance network security. Our latest endeavor is our graduation project, which revolves around the small enterprise network model.

In our arsenal, we've integrated powerful tools such as aircrack-ng, nmap, and routersploit. These tools empower us to conduct thorough assessments and uncover vulnerabilities within network infrastructures.

For the execution of our project, we leveraged the versatile platform of GNS3 and incorporated physical wireless network devices to simulate real-world scenarios. Our toolset is designed to operate in two distinct modes: Black box and white box, ensuring comprehensive coverage in vulnerability identification and assessment.

We extend our sincere gratitude to everyone who has utilized our project and supported us throughout this journey.

Best regards,

Team Pennet
