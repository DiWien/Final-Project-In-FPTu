## 1.1 Purpose

Hi everybody,

We are the Pennet team, specializing in applying advanced pentesting methods to improve network security. Our latest graduate project revolves around the small business networking model.

## 1.2 Team

We, the Pennet team, have integrated powerful tools like aircrack-ng, nmap, and routersploit into our arsenal. These tools allow us to conduct detailed assessments and detect vulnerabilities in network infrastructure.

# Tools used

## 2.1 aircrack-ng
## 2.2 nmap
## 2.3 routersploit

# Deployment method

## 3.1 GNS3 Platform

To implement the project, we used the GNS3 general-purpose platform and integrated physical wireless network devices to simulate real-life scenarios.

## 3.2 Physical wireless network equipment

# Tool operating mode

## 4.1 Black box
## 4.2 White box

Our toolkit is designed to operate in two different modes: Black box and White box, ensuring comprehensive coverage in identifying and assessing vulnerabilities.

# Thank you

We would like to extend our sincere thanks to everyone who has used our project and supported us along this journey.
