**WiFi Pentest Policy (Within Project Scope)**

**Agreement and Legal Compliance:**
- Pentesting is only conducted with the explicit consent and agreement of the system or Wi-Fi network owner.
- Adherence to all relevant legal regulations and policies regarding security testing.

**Recording and Information Security:**
- Comprehensive recording of all pentesting activities and outcomes.
- Stringent information security measures to prevent sensitive data from falling into unauthorized hands.

**Scope Definition:**
- Clear delineation of the pentest scope, including specific devices and Wi-Fi networks authorized for assessment.
- Limitation of impact on unrelated devices and networks (internal machinery).

**Security Assessment:**
- Utilization of appropriate tools and techniques to assess Wi-Fi network security, encompassing WEP, WPA, and WPA2 vulnerabilities.
- Examination of configuration, encryption, and Wi-Fi network authentication methods.

**Reporting and Evaluation:**
- Creation of detailed reports highlighting vulnerabilities, weaknesses, and recommendations for security enhancement.
- Assessment of risk levels associated with each vulnerability and recommendation of prioritized measures for remediation.

**Ethics and Responsibility:**
- Conducting all activities with the highest ethical standards and sense of responsibility during the pentest process, avoiding unnecessary harm to systems or networks.
- Respect for the privacy and security of Wi-Fi network users.

**Learning and Knowledge Update:**
- Continuous updating of knowledge and skills in Wi-Fi network security to address emerging threats.
- Learning from new pentest techniques and practical experiences.

**Router Pentest Policy:**

**Agreement and Legal Compliance:**
- Ensuring prior consent and agreement from the router owner before conducting any pentest-related activities.
- Identification and compliance with all relevant legal regulations and policies regarding security testing.

**Scope Definition:**
- Clearly defining the scope of router pentest, including specific router devices and related network services.
- Restricting impact on unrelated devices and services outside the pentest scope.

**Security Assessment:**
- Utilization of suitable tools and techniques to assess router security, including default configuration checks, open network ports, software, and firmware updates.
- Examination of router login and management protocol security, as well as wireless network configuration and security.

**Recording and Information Security:**
- Thorough recording of all pentest activities and outcomes.
- Stringent information security measures to safeguard sensitive data.

**Reporting and Evaluation:**
- Generation of detailed reports outlining router vulnerabilities, weaknesses, and recommendations for security improvement.
- Evaluation of risk levels associated with each vulnerability and proposal of prioritized measures for mitigation.

**Ethics and Responsibility:**
- Conducting all activities with utmost ethics and responsibility during the pentest process, minimizing unnecessary harm to systems or networks.
- Respect for the privacy and security of router users and owners.

**Learning and Knowledge Update:**
- Continuous updating of knowledge and skills in router security to address emerging threats.
- Learning from new pentest techniques and practical experiences.

**DMZ Pentest Policy:**

**Attack Approach:**

**Vulnerability Assessment:**
- Utilization of Metasploit modules to exploit known vulnerabilities in services or applications running on servers within the DMZ network.
- Use of tools like msfconsole to discover security vulnerabilities on servers and services.

**Spoofing Attacks:**
- Employment of Metasploit modules to create spoofed packets and conduct spoofing attacks on IP and MAC addresses within the DMZ network.
- Spoofing attacks may lead to deception of systems and control over network traffic.
